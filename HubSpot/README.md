# Overview
- Folloze offers an integration with HubSpot using a script that connects Folloze forms and HubSpot. 
- This integration allows for identity to be captured by Folloze for the purpose of behavioral analytics (accounts, contacts), Personalization and AI, as well as synching form submissions to HubSpot for marketing automation and lead management purposes.
- Forms can be placed in multiple places in the board such as a call-to-action, open form, gating form or registration forms.
- The Folloze forms can be created via the standard form builder or custom forms.
