# Overview
Folloze offers an integration with HubSpot using custom Javascript that connects Folloze Forms to HubSpot. 
This integration allows for identity to be captured by Folloze for the purpose of behavioral analytics (accounts, contacts), Personalization and AI, as well as synching form submissions to HubSpot for marketing automation and lead management purposes. Forms can be used in sections or behind CTAs on Folloze Boards. They can be leveraged in various ways such as for demo requests, content gating, or registration.

Folloze Forms can be created via the standard form builder or custom forms. Learn more about building Folloze Forms:
